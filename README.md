# community-platform
The new CoderDojo Community Platform. This is the main repoisitory for the Community Platform.

## Repositories

* cp-zen-web: The main portal, this is publicly accessible zen content, and should be similar to the existing http://zen.coderdojo.com site today.
* cp-zen-platform: The main repo for the 'logged in' content, this is the main entry point for all the angular/microservice based plugins.
* cp-core-services: This is where we'll keep the core backend microservices for now (these may be refactored out of here at a later date).
* cp-deployer: This is the nscale deployer, for local development and deployment to staging/production.
