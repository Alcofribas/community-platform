# Zen, the CoderDojo Community Platform

Welcome to 'Zen'! You can see the live site at [zen.coderdojo.com](https://zen.coderdojo.com).

## Contributing to Zen

There are various ways to contribute to Zen:

* as a developer, instructions for creating a local development environment can be found in the ['local dev'](https://github.com/CoderDojo/cp-local-development) repository. You may also wish to read the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
* as a translator, we use [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/zen-community-platform) to help manage localisation, please sign up and help out!
* issue management, we keep track of all our issues in GitHub in this repo, help out [here](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/issues)
* documentation, by contributing to the documentation in this repository.

## Where to begin

View our [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/helloworldfoundation/contributing-to-zen-the-coderdojo-open-source-community-platform)!

There are a few labels in particular that are very useful if you are new to Zen:
* The [suitable for beginners](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/suitable%20for%20beginners) label marks anything considered easy enough for a first time contributor. 
* The [request for comments](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/request%20for%20comments) label is great for non-coders or people wishing to get familiar with the system. These are often features we are not sure if we want to produce yet, or issues that require clearer implementation guidelines.
* The [hints provided](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/hints%20provided) label is attached to anything which has been given a technical spec by someone on the development team.

### Bug fixes

* Ideally all of the [bugs](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/bug) are the most important issues to fix. They are categorised by priority. 
* There is a [critical bugs milestone](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/milestones/Critical%20bugs) for the most important bugs.
* Some bugs are smaller CSS issues that are marked low priority and so are not as important to work on. 


### Priorities for the project

Once you're familiar with the codebase, there are a number of labels/milestones to guide you through our roadmap.
- Our [top priority](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/top%20priority) label is for features which are the most important
- For immediate issues, there is a section for [Q4 2015](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/milestones/2015%20Q4%20issues%20to%20complete)
- Issues are sorted by other priority levels, [low](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/low%20priority), [normal](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/normal%20priority) and [high](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/labels/high%20priority)
- We also have a [short term roadmap](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/milestones/Short%20term%20roadmap) and [long term roadmap](https://github.com/CoderDojo/community-platform/milestones/Long%20term%20roadmap)

#### Working on an issue?

- Comment on it and let us know so we don't duplicate any effort.
- We can add you to the official CoderDojo development team so you can assign yourself issues. 
- Tag [@tangentfairy](https://github.com/tangentfairy) if you have any questions
